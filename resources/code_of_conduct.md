## What is a code of conduct?

A code of conduct is a policy used by an organization such as a conference, workplace, open source project, or event venue. At a minimum it states what behaviors are not acceptable, how the organization will enforce the policy, who the policy applies to, and how to make a report of a code of conduct violation.

## Why do you need one?

> A Code of Conduct is a public statement that sets the ground rules for participating in an event. Our conferences boast attendees from all over the world, coming from many different backgrounds and experiences; our expectations of what is appropriate are not always in line with one another.

## What does an effective code of conduct look like?

An effective code of conduct will cover:

### 1. A statement of intent

What values or goals does your organization have? How do those values relate to the safety of attendees?

### 2. A list of specific behaviors considered inappropriate

These need to cover common types of harassment and abuse. Specifics are important because they reduce the ambiguity of these requests: it's easier to understand and follow 'when someone says they don't want to talk to you, stop' versus 'don't be a jerk'.

### 3. An open-ended list of actions the organization may take in response to those behaviors

Participants need to know the range of things that could happen: are you going to ask everyone to leave? Permanently? These details help everyone understand you take their safety seriously, and show people who might not be acting in good faith that there will be consequences.

### 4. Additional expectations about participation in the organization, event, or space

Some communities have other social rules that aren't directly about harassment, like the [Recurse Center's](https://www.recurse.com/manual) "No feigning suprise" and "No well-actuallys".

### 5. The scope of who the policy affects

Most of our events and groups have some aspect of open participation, so we need to be clear about who's under these policies. Does it include sponsors? Vendors providing a service?

### 6. Who to contact to report a violation, and how to contact them

Without this, you won't have a working policy.

### Optional items

- Additional reporting details or guidelines: do you have a formal reporting policy or a form to fill out? Link to it.
- Additional relevant resources for assisting participants such as urgent care medical clinics, crisis lines, resource centers

If there's anything else you expect people to do, more details you can provide about your process, or outside resources they can access, include them as well.

## Example codes of conduct to use

- [Geek Feminism Conference Anti-Harassment Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
- [Lambda Ladies Code of Conduct](http://www.lambdaladies.com/code-of-conduct/)

## How do you share it your community?

- post in all public areas or materials, such as conference venues, websites, code repositories
- include in announcements to all participants
- discuss the intent and use of the code of conduct with your community
- train organizers, staff, volunteers on its use

Make time at the start of your meetings and events to talk about the code of conduct. Particpants need to hear why it's important and what they're expected to do.
