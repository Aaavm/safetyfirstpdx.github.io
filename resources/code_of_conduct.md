# Example for a Code of Conduct

The [citizen code of conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) was created by [Stumptown Syndicate](http://stumptownsyndicate.org/) for the [Open Source Bridge conference](http://opensourcebridge.org/). We encourage you to use it as the basis for a similar document for your own communities.

Why do we need a code of conduct? We want open source to be safe and welcoming for all interested participants, but unfortunately that is not always the case. Our intent is to provide clear information about desired and undesired behaviors in our communities, and to enable community members to take action toward making these spaces better for everyone.
