title: Incident Reponse
---

Your incident response plan needs to be flexible enough for anything that could happen in your scope of activities, and specific enough that everyone involved knows what they need to do. You can [download our template](/training/code_of_conduct/TemplateIncidentResponseGuide.pdf) as a starting point.

## Roles

A community may have:

- Participants
- Volunteers
- Staff members and organizers
- Supporting organizations or boards

Your **primary responders** should be people who can take responsibility for your community's response to an incident. You also need to prevent conflicts of interest: no couples or family members working together. Don't take on this responsibility alone: two or more people are needed to hold each other accountable.

Describe what each set of participants and organizers is expected to do.

## Making a plan

Map out what kinds of situations you've had in the past or are concerned about encountering. Decide in advance how you'd like to handle it. Common issues can be fully scripted out, and more unusual or complex systems will benefit from a more formal decision-making process. See the template for an example.

## Training

People forget things in the middle of a chaotic situation. In addition to a written plan, it's highly beneficial to practice. You can attend one of our [community training sessions](/training/code_of_conduct) for this.
