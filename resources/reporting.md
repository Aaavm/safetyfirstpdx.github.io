## How to take a report on code of conduct-related issues

This is often a stressful and tense moment for everyone involved. Don't rush, and follow your process. If you're currently in a public space or context, move the conversation to a private one.

Never contradict what the person making the report says to you, even if it doesn't make sense at the time or you have different opinions about the people involved. Ask clarifing questions if needed to help you better understand the situation. Offer the person a quiet place to recover afterward, if the report is made in person.

## Information to collect

- Contact information for the reporting person
- Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Names of witnesses, if available
- When and where the incident occurred
- The account of what occurred
  - If there is a publicly available record, include the links
- Context, if available. Do the people know each other? Is there a past incident the reporter is aware of?
- Is the situation ongoing?
- Additional information and notes that may help the responders

## Taking reports and being aware of privacy

It's important to maintain the privacy of the reporter and all others involved during this process, so move the reporting to a private communication method or space as quickly as possible. Decide whether you'll take reports via email, phone calls, other message systems, or in person. There are a number of tools that will let you set up a phone number and voicemail box all responders can access, and some also do SMS. For online reporting you should have a shared incoming email address like safety@example.org. You could also connect this with a web form.

Agree with your fellow reporters and response team on what kinds of records you'll keep and how they'll be stored. You may need to consider trade-offs between privacy, security, and accountability, as well as any legal implications for the information you gather.

Factors that may affect your handling of these records:

- Is there a possibility of the information being subpoenaed? Will you need it for your own legal use?
- Do you have adequate physical security for paper copies and digital security for the rest?
- Have you agreed on a retention policy? Will you need to refer back to notes at a future event?

## Follow up and response

Make sure to let people know how soon they'll have a response from you, and what the time frame is for your actions. Posting an outline of your reporting process with your code of conduct is helpful.
