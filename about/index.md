title: About

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.

We intend to educate ourselves and members of our community on what problems exist, and the most effective steps we can take to address them.

Safety First PDX is a program of [Stumptown Syndicate](https://stumptownsydicate.org). Our events and communications are subject to the [Stumptown Syndicate Code of Conduct](http://stumptownsyndicate.org/code-of-conduct/) and incidents may be reported by following the [Stumptown Syndicate Reporting Guidelines](http://stumptownsyndicate.org/code-of-conduct/reporting-guidelines/).
