tagline: Community Safety and Accountability in Technology Communities
---

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.

In order to eliminate harassment and abuse, we educate ourselves and members of our community on the problems that exist and the steps we can take to address them, as well as creating community-specific resources and making space for discussions about these issues.

Safety First PDX is a program of Stumptown Syndicate. Our events and communications are subject to the Stumptown Syndicate Code of Conduct and incidents may be reported by following the Stumptown Syndicate Reporting Guidelines.

## Next Event
