tagline: Community Safety and Accountability in PDX Tech and Beyond
---

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.

In order to eliminate harassment and abuse, we educate ourselves and members of our community on the problems that exist and the steps we can take to address them, as well as creating community-specific resources and making space for discussions about these issues

Get involved! Email sfp@stumptownsyndicate.org to find out how, or check out [the repository for this site on GitHub](https://github.com/safetyfirstpdx/safetyfirstpdx.github.io).
