tagline: Community Safety and Accountability in Technology Communities
---

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.

We are discussing what problems exist in our communities, and the most effective steps we can take to address them.

Safety First PDX is a program of Stumptown Syndicate. Our events and communications are subject to the Stumptown Syndicate Code of Conduct and incidents may be reported by following the Stumptown Syndicate Reporting Guidelines.


## Next Event

Our next office hour is happening on January 23, Noon PST at [http://meet.jit.si/safetyfirst](http://meet.jit.si/safetyfirst).

The topic: Working on completely open events (such as FOSSDEM).
