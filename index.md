tagline: Community Safety and Accountability in PDX Tech and Beyond
---

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.

We intend to educate ourselves and members of our community on what problems exist, and the most effective steps we can take to address them.

Get involved! Email sfp@stumptownsyndicate.org to find out how, or check out [the repository for this site on GitHub](https://github.com/safetyfirstpdx/safetyfirstpdx.github.io).
