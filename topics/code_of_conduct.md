## What is a code of conduct?

A code of conduct is a policy used by an organization such as a conference, workplace, open source project, or event venue. At a minimum it states what behaviors are not acceptable, how the organization will enforce the policy, who the policy applies to, and how to make a report of a code of conduct violation.

## Why do you need one?

> A Code of Conduct is a public statement that sets the ground rules for participating in an event. Our conferences boast attendees from all over the world, coming from many different backgrounds and experiences; our expectations of what is appropriate are not always in line with one another.

## What does an effective code of conduct look like?

An effective code of conduct will cover:

- a statement of intent
- a list of specific behaviors considered inappropriate
- an open-ended list of actions the organization may take in response to those behaviors
- additional expectations about participation in the organization, event, or space
- the scope of who the policy affects
- who to contact to report a violation, and how to contact them
- (optional) additional reporting details or guidelines
- (optional) additional relevant resources for assisting participants such as urgent care medical clinics, crisis lines, resource centers

## How do you share it your community?

- post in all public areas or materials, such as conference venues, websites, code repositories
- include in announcements to all participants
- discuss the intent and use of the code of conduct with your community
- train organizers, staff, volunteers on its use
